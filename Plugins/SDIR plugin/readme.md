# Add plugin configuration

The `Shopware plugin system` provides you with the option to create a configuration page for your plugin without any knowledge of templating or the `Shopware Administration`.

## Prerequisites

To build your own configuration page for your plugin, you first need a plugin as base. Therefore, you can refer to the [Plugin Base Guide](../documentation.md).
